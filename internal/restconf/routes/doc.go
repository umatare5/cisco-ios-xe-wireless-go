// Package routes provides centralized RESTCONF API endpoint constants for all services.
//
// This package consolidates endpoint definitions from all service packages to provide
// a single source of truth for RESTCONF API routes. Each service's endpoints are
// organized in separate files for maintainability while being centrally managed.
//
// The endpoints follow the RESTCONF API specification and are based on Cisco IOS-XE
// YANG models for wireless controller operations.
