// Package testutil provides public testing utilities for the Cisco IOS-XE Wireless Go client SDK.
//
// This package offers mock RESTCONF servers (NewMockServer, NewMockErrorServer) and test client
// abstractions (NewTestClient) for service layer testing. It provides interface-based abstractions
// that hide internal implementation details while enabling comprehensive testing scenarios.
// Key components include TestClient interface, MockServer interface, and RESTCONF mock utilities.
