A Go library for interacting with Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Network Controller.

- **üîß Developer Friendly**: Transparent YANG model handling with all responses in JSON format
- **üìä Comprehensive Coverage**: Access most status information and metrics available from the WNC
- **üöÄ Quick Integration**: Get started in minutes with simple configuration and clear examples
- **üéØ Type-Safe Operations**: Strongly-typed Go structs for all API interactions and responses
- **üìñ Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed API reference, testing guides, and best practices

## üì° Supported Environment

Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Network Controller running Cisco IOS-XE `17.12.x`.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
go get github.com/umatare5/cisco-xe-wireless-restconf-go
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üîë Creating Basic Auth Token

You must create a Basic Auth token using your Cisco WNC credentials before using the client.

```bash
# Create token for username:password
echo -n "admin:your-password" | base64
# Output: YWRtaW46eW91ci1wYXNzd29yZA==
```

### üîß Basic Usage

Start with this simple example to verify your WNC connection and credentials.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"

    wnc "github.com/umatare5/cisco-xe-wireless-restconf-go"
)

func main() {
    // Create client with controller and access token
    client, err := wnc.NewClient("192.168.1.100", "YWRtaW46eW91ci1wYXNzd29yZA==")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to create client: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    // Get AP operational data with context timeout
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    apData, err := client.GetApOper(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to get AP data: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Successfully connected! Found %d APs\n", len(apData.CiscoIOSXEWirelessAccessPointOperAccessPointOperData.OperData))
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

Customize client behavior using configuration options to optimize for your specific environment and requirements.

```go
import (
    "log/slog"
    "time"

    wnc "github.com/umatare5/cisco-xe-wireless-restconf-go"
)

// Create client with custom timeout and skip TLS verification
client, err := wnc.NewClient(
    "192.168.1.100",
    "YWRtaW46eW91ci1wYXNzd29yZA==",
    wnc.WithTimeout(30*time.Second),
    wnc.WithInsecureSkipVerify(true), // Only for development
)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to create client: %v\n", err)
    return
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The `WithInsecureSkipVerify(true)` option disables TLS certificate verification. This should only be used in development environments or when connecting to controllers with self-signed certificates. **Never use this option in production environments** as it compromises security.

### üìä Custom Logging

The library supports structured logging using Go's standard `slog` package.

```go
import (
    "log/slog"
    "os"

    wnc "github.com/umatare5/cisco-xe-wireless-restconf-go"
)

logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
    Level: slog.LevelDebug,
}))

client, err := wnc.NewClient(
    "192.168.1.100",
    "YWRtaW46eW91ci1wYXNzd29yZA==",
    wnc.WithLogger(logger),
)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

All configuration options are applied during client creation and cannot be changed afterward.

| Option                   | Parameter       | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `WithTimeout`            | `time.Duration` | Sets custom timeout for HTTP requests (default: 20s) |
| `WithInsecureSkipVerify` | `bool`          | Skips TLS certificate verification (dev only)        |
| `WithLogger`             | `*slog.Logger`  | Sets custom structured logger instance               |

## üåê API Reference

The library provides a set of functions for interacting with all major Cisco Catalyst 9800 WNC subsystems. For detailed API documentation, please see **[API_REFERENCE.md](./docs/API_REFERENCE.md)**.

## üß™ Testing

This library includes comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and compatibility with Cisco Catalyst 9800 controllers. For detailed testing information, please see **[TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md)**.
