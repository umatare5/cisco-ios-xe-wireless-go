# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode â€“ General Instructions

This repository has a Go client library (SDK) for the RESTCONF API of the Cisco Catalyst C9800 Wireless LAN Controller.

This library enables developers to communicate with Cisco Catalyst 9800 controllers in an idiomatic, robust, simple, and maintainable way using Go.

It is intended to be imported and used as a component in other Go applicationsâ€”not as a standalone application.

This Go SDK is designed to be **clear, stable, easy to use, highly readable, and maintainable**. It strictly follows established best practices for Go development, API design, and technical documentation, with a strong emphasis on overall code quality, readability, and maintainability.

Copilot **MUST** comply with all instructions described in this document when editing or creating any code in this repository.
